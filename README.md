## Implemented Actions

### code-sanitizer

### go-code-formatter-linter-vetter

[GitHub Action to run go formatter, linter, and vetter scans against the GO source files](https://github.com/dell/common-github-actions/blob/main/go-code-formatter-linter-vetter/README.md)

### go-code-tester

### malware-scanner

[GitHub Action to run ClamScan AntiVirus Scan against source](https://github.com/dell/common-github-actions/blob/main/malware-scanner/README.md)

## Implemented Workflows

In addition to the actions mentioned above, the repository contains workflows that are used by various projects.

### go-static-analysis

This workflow runs static analysis checks against repositories that utilize Golang as the primary development language. The jobs that are run include:
* golanci-lint with gofumpt (stricter version of gofmt), gosec, govet, and revive (replacement for golint). The configuration file for this job can be found at [.github/configs/golangci-lint/golangci.yaml](.github/configs/golangci-lint/golangci.yaml)
* malware_security_scan, which is the malware-scanner mentioned above
* yaml_lint_scan which validates yaml files. The yamllint config file for this job is at [.github/configs/yamllint/yamllint.yaml](.github/configs/yamllint/yamllint.yaml)

The workflow does not accept any parameters and can be used from any repo by creating a workflow that resembles the following

```
name: Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]

jobs:

  # golang static analysis checks
  go-static-analysis:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/go-static-analysis.yaml@main
    name: Golang Validation
```
