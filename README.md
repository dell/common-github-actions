## Implemented Workflows

In addition to the actions mentioned above, the repository contains workflows that are used by various projects.

### go-static-analysis

This workflow runs static analysis checks against repositories that utilize Golang as the primary development language. The jobs that are run include:

- golanci-lint with gofumpt (stricter version of gofmt), gosec, govet, and revive (replacement for golint). The configuration file for this job can be found at [.github/configs/golangci-lint/golangci.yaml](.github/configs/golangci-lint/golangci.yaml)
- yaml_lint_scan which validates yaml files. The yamllint config file for this job is at [.github/configs/yamllint/yamllint.yaml](.github/configs/yamllint/yamllint.yaml)

The workflow does not accept any parameters and can be used from any repo by creating a workflow that resembles the following

```yaml
name: Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]

jobs:

  # golang static analysis checks
  go-static-analysis:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/go-static-analysis.yaml@main
    name: Golang Validation
```

### csm-release-libs

This workflow automates the release process for all the Go Client Libraries:

The workflow accepts version as an input and releases that particular version. Below is the example usage in gobrick repository. If no version is specified then it will automatically bump up the major version.

```yaml
name: Release Gobrick
# Invocable as a reusable workflow
# Can be manually triggered
on:
  workflow_call:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to release (major, minor, patch)'
        required: true
        default: 'none'
jobs:
  csm-release:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/csm-release-libs.yaml@main
    name: Release Go Client Libraries
```

### go-version-workflow

This workflow updates to the latest go version in repositories that utilize Golang as the primary development language. The workflow is triggered by https://github.com/dell/common-github-actions/actions/workflows/trigger-go-workflow.yaml or can be triggered manually.

The workflow does not accept any parameters and can be used from any repository by creating a workflow that resembles the following
Note: Workflows that call reusable workflows in the same organization or enterprise can use the inherit keyword to implicitly pass the secrets. See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows#passing-inputs-and-secrets-to-a-reusable-workflow.

```yaml
name: Go Version Update

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [go-update-workflow]

jobs:
  go-version-update:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/go-version-workflow.yaml@main
    name: Go Version Update
    secrets: inherit
```

### go-common

This workflow runs multiple checks against repositories that utilize Golang as the primary development language. Currently, this workflow will run unit tests, check package coverage, gosec, go formatter and vetter, and malware scan.

```
name: Common Workflows
on:  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]

jobs:

  common:
    name: Quality Checks
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/go-common.yml@main
```

### csm-release-driver-module

This workflow automates the release of CSM drivers and modules repositories. The workflow accepts two parameters as version and image, and can be used from any repo by creating a workflow that resembles the following.
The manual workflow is recommended to be used for out of band releases such as patch releases or when the increment is a major version change.

For manual trigger from driver and module repositories, here is the example for the csi-powerscale repo:

```yaml
name: Release CSIPowerScale
on:
  workflow_call:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to release (major, minor, patch) Ex: 1.0.0'
        required: true
      image:
        description: 'Image name to release Ex: csi-isilon'
        required: true

jobs:
  release:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/csm-release-driver-module.yaml@main
    name: Release CSM Drivers and Modules
    with:
      version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
      image: ${{ github.event.inputs.image }}
    secrets: inherit
```

For Auto release of the driver and module repositories, here is the example for the csi-powerscale repo:

```yaml
name: Auto Release CSIPowerScale
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [auto-release-workflow]

jobs:
  calculate-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      new-version: ${{ steps.set-version.outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch the full history including tags

      - name: Get latest release version
        id: get-latest-version
        run: |
          latest_version=$(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
          echo "latest_version=${latest_version}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Increment minor version and remove 'v' prefix
        id: set-version
        run: |
          version=${{ env.latest_version }}
          clean_version=${version#v}

          # Parse version parts
          major=$(echo $clean_version | cut -d'.' -f1)
          minor=$(echo $clean_version | cut -d'.' -f2)
          patch=$(echo $clean_version | cut -d'.' -f3)
          new_minor=$((minor + 1))
          new_version="${major}.${new_minor}.0"

          echo "New version: $new_version"
          echo "::set-output name=version::$new_version"

  csm-release:
    needs: calculate-version
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/csm-release-driver-module.yaml@main
    with:
      version: ${{ inputs.version || needs.calculate-version.outputs.new-version }}
      image: "csi-isilon"  # Please provide the appropriate image name
    secrets: inherit
```

## update-dependencies-to-commits
This workflow updates Dell libraries to their **latest commits** in repositories that utilize Golang as the primary development language. The workflow is triggered automatically, but can be triggered manually as well.
The workflow does not accept any parameters and can be used from any repository by creating a workflow that resembles the following:
```
name: Dell Libraries Commit Update
on:  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  library-update:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/update-libraries-to-commits.yml@main
    name: Dell Libraries Update
```

## update-libraries
This workflow updates Dell libraries to the **latest released** version in repositories that utilize Golang as the primary development language. The workflow can be manually triggered only.
The workflow does not accept any parameters and can be used from any repository by creating a workflow that resembles the following:
```
name: Dell Libraries Latest Update
on:  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  library-update:
    uses: dell/common-github-actions/.github/workflows/update-libraries.yml@main
    name: Dell Libraries Update
```
