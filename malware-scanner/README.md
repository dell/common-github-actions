# Code GO-Security GitHub Action
This GitHub Action can be used to check sources files for malwares.
This action uses [ClamAV malware scanner](https://www.clamav.net/).



To enable this Action, you can create a .yml file under your repo's .github/workflows directory. 
Simple example:

```
name: Malware Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
    malware_security_scan:
      name: Malware Scanner
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout the code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Malware Scanner
          uses: dell/common-github-actions/malware-scanner@main
          with:
            directories: .
            options: -ri
```

* The `directories` for the Action is a path in which to check for these issues. You can use `.` (default if no `directories` are provided) to check from the root of the repo.
* The `options`  for the Action are a character sequence representing valid flags for [clamscan command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/clamscan).
