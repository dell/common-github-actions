# How to get support for GitHub Actions in this repo

We're using GitHub issues as our primary support avenue. 

## Questions

You have a question about and cannot find the answer in the documenation? 
Use the **[Ask a Question](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ask-a-question.md)** template and fill out the required fields.

## Defects

Use the **[Bug Report](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)** template to submit any bugs you find.
Provide as much details as possible about the issue encountered, your environment, steps to reproduce the issue,
screenshots, logs, stack traces, and anything else that can describe the problem. The more details are initially provided, the faster the bug can be reproduced and triaged.

## Feature Requests

Do you have concrete ideas on how to improve a GitHub Action? Open a **[Feature Request](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)** and submit your idea to the community.
As with defects, a detailed description of your feature request will help maintainers evaluate the value and feasibility of your request more quickly.
When a request has been reviewed and accepted, it will be being scheduled for a future release, resulting in a related pull request.

## Pull Request

Completed work on a defect or feature can be contributed back to the project via a **[Pull Request](../.github/pull_request_template.md)** 
A Pull Request must be related to an existing defect or feature in order to be accepted. Further, the pull request template contains a checklist that needs to be reviewed in order to comply with our quality gates.
